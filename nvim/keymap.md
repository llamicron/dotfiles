# NeoVim Keymaps

This is a non-exhaustive list of keymaps that I use. I'll add more here as I see necessary.

## Basic Movement
* `h`, `j`, `k`, `l` - basic vim movement
* `w`, `b` - jump forward/backward by word
* `W`, `B` - jump forward/backward by symbol
* `A` - move to end of line in insert mode
* `I` - move to beginning of line in insert mode
* `o` - create new line below and enter insert mode
* `O` - create new line above and enter insert mode
* `0` - jump to column 0
* `$` - jump to end of line
* `^` - jump to first non-whitespace character of line


## Project Navigation
* `<leader>pv` - Project view explorer (same as :Ex)
* `<leader>pf` - Project find (fuzzy find a file)
* `<leader>ps` - Project search (grep through project and find all files that match)
* `<C-p>` - Project git find (fuzzy find all files in Git)

## Editing
* `z` - folding stuff (and more)

# Neovim Configuration

Hello future Luke. This is your NeoVim configuration.
`lua/llamicron/` contains shit about getting packages installed and various configuration.
`after/` contains individual package configuration. `keymap.md` is a guide that you wrote for remembering the keymaps that you use.

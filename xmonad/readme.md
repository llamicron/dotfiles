# XMonad shortcuts

Some helpful things to remember for my setup. Super = windows button.

* Workspaces
    * `super + #` = go to a specific workspace
    * `super + shift + #` = send current window to that workspace
    * `super + w` = switch focus to left monitor
    * `super + e` = switch focus to right monitor
    * `super + [hjkl]` = move focus between windows (vim style movement)
    * `super + space` = switch layout mode
    * `super + enter` = switch focused window to main position
* Applications/Media:
    * `super + shift + [,.]` = volume -/+  by 5%
    * `super + shift + enter` = start terminal
    * `super + shift + [` = screenshot rectangular area
    * `super + shift + ]` = screenshot current window
    * `super + f` = firefox

System:
